## Overview
The primary objective of this project is to investigate student performance and explore the impact of various factors such as attendance, study habits, and socio-economic conditions on their academic outcomes. This analysis includes multiple statistical techniques and visualizations to provide meaningful insights.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains various features related to student demographics, academic background, and behavioral traits.

- **Source**: [Kaggle Student Performance Dataset]([https://www.kaggle.com/](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors))
- **Data Cleaning**: The dataset undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and formatting inconsistencies.

### Description of Features
- **Hours_Studied**: Number of hours spent studying per week.
- **Attendance**: Percentage of classes attended.
- **Parental_Involvement**: Level of parental involvement in the student's education (Low, Medium, High).
- **Access_to_Resources**: Availability of educational resources (Low, Medium, High).
- **Extracurricular_Activities**: Participation in extracurricular activities (Yes, No).
- **Sleep_Hours**: Average number of hours of sleep per night.
- **Previous_Scores**: Scores from previous exams.
- **Motivation_Level**: Student's level of motivation (Low, Medium, High).
- **Internet_Access**: Availability of internet access (Yes, No).
- **Tutoring_Sessions**: Number of tutoring sessions attended per month.
- **Family_Income**: Family income level (Low, Medium, High).
- **Teacher_Quality**: Quality of the teachers (Low, Medium, High).
- **School_Type**: Type of school attended (Public, Private).
- **Peer_Influence**: Influence of peers on academic performance (Positive, Neutral, Negative).
- **Physical_Activity**: Average number of hours of physical activity per week.
- **Learning_Disabilities**: Presence of learning disabilities (Yes, No).

## Analysis Categories
The project focuses on the following categories of analysis:

1. **General Trends and Descriptive Analysis**  
   Explore basic statistics and trends in the dataset.

2. **Correlation and Relationships**  
   Analyze the relationships between different variables and performance.

3. **Comparative Analysis**  
   Compare performance based on various categorical factors like gender, location, etc.

4. **Impact of Multiple Factors on Performance**  
   Investigate how multiple variables combined affect academic outcomes.

5. **Categorical Comparisons**  
   Analyze the impact of categorical variables such as study hours, extracurricular activities, etc.

6. **Time-Related Insights**  
   Explore the effect of time-related variables (e.g., study duration) on performance.

7. **Behavioral Insights**  
   Analyze how student behavior impacts their academic results.

8. **Predictive Relationships**  
   Use machine learning techniques to predict performance based on various features.

9. **Group Analysis**  
   Examine the performance of groups of students (e.g., by region or class).

10. **Outlier Analysis**  
    Identify and analyze unusual data points.

11. **Clustering & Segmentation**  
    Use clustering techniques to group students based on similar characteristics.

12. **Hypothetical Scenarios**  
    Explore what-if scenarios and their impact on performance.
